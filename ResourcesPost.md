All Advancements: Shulker Box Retiming

After an extremely productive afternoon in AA VC, I've developed a tool to allow extracting the time spent within shulker boxes in AA run recordings.

Here's a video going over some of the conclusions we gleaned along the way (thanks to Fudge & Pac for running this in parallel to get more runs done): https://youtu.be/v7UJrLvbqdE

Here's a link to the repository, where I've tried to document the process for doing this yourself in the readme: https://github.com/DesktopFolder/vodanalyze.git

Google Sheets with current analyzed runs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sh1xGpPBBYC3f9YXBeMPNDmau9NX4Y9ibclnjg5tAmw/edit?usp=sharing

**This project is a part of a broader attempt to improve knowledge of AA strats and efficiency.** For the interested, I've also looked into the following (much less rigorously):

- Underground VS Aboveground Wither: Which is faster? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1H6uU8djCc> (Underground, always)
- Normal Raid VS Mansion: Which is faster? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8-aj7-hEcU> (Raid, usually)
